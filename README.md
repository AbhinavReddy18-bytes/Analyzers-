# Analyzers- Comparitive Study of legal Analysis using different AI Models

We have collected datasets for penal codes and we have scrapped the website for the csv files of 2 states in US (California and New York) which we wanted for experimenting.
Then we have manually edited csv files for inconsistent rows and columns and made it as in 3 formats:
1. Uncleaned Dataset
2. Cleaned Dataset - 
3. Combined Dataset

Next we have used some general preprocessing techniques like Normalization, tokenizatization, textcleaning and vectorization and many more..
